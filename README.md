# OSMC_Dashboard
DASH implementation of the OSMC Dashboard.

We are currently using [a version based on Holoviz](https://github.com/NOAA-PMEL/osmc_dashboard), but we may revisit this at some point.

If you want to use this Notebook, you need this conda environment:

```
name: DASH
channels:
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - pandas
  - dash
  - gunicorn
  ```
